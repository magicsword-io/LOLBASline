## Features üåü

- **Automated LOLBAS Repository Cloning:** If no local path is provided, LOLBASline will clone the latest LOLBAS project repository to retrieve the YAML files containing binary information.
- **Presence Verification:** Checks if the LOLBAS binaries exist on the system.
- **Execution Capability Test:** Attempts to execute a representative command for each binary to verify execution capabilities.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Outputs a comprehensive CSV report detailing the binaries checked, their presence, ability to execute commands, and additional metadata from the LOLBAS YAML definitions.

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Do not run LOLBASline on a production system.** This script attempts to execute commands that can trigger security alerts, potentially disrupt system operations, and may be flagged by security solutions as malicious activity.
